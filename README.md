# Enhancing Mental Health Care A Proposed Approach for Depression Detection using CNN and LSTM-Model

The document presents an innovative approach to mental health care through the development of a machine learning model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the detection of depression from textual data. This model, designed to analyze social media posts, discussions, and blogs, has shown a remarkable accuracy of 93.41% in identifying depression, surpassing existing methods. By harnessing advanced AI techniques, this research not only contributes to early and precise detection of depression but also holds significant potential in providing timely intervention and personalized care, thereby enhancing the overall mental health support system. The study represents a major advancement in utilizing sophisticated machine learning architectures to address pressing societal issues related to mental health and well-being.
